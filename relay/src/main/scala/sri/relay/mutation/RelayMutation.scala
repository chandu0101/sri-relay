    * a consistent view of the data after performing a mutation. In practice, we
    * query for a subset of those fields because we intersect the fat query with
    * the tracked query we have for a given node (ie. the pieces of data we've
    * previously queried for and have therefore written to the store).
    *
    * Fat queries can be written like normal graphql queries with one main
    * exception: fat queries use childless non-scalar fields to indicate that
    * anything under that field may change. For example, the fat query for
    * feedback_like contains the field `like_sentence` with no child fields.
    * This means that any field below `like_sentence` may change as a result of
    * feedback_like.
    *
    * When adding a fat query, consider *all* of the data that might change as a
    * result of the mutation - not just data that we currently use in Relay. We
    * don't need to worry about overfetching here (this query is never executed
    * on its own; the infrastructure always intersects it with what is actually
    * needed), and if we omit fields here we might get odd consistency behavior
    * in the future when we add new views or modify existing ones.

    * These configurations are used to generate the query for the mutation to be
    * sent to the server and to correctly write the server's response into the
    * client store.
    *
    * Possible configuration types:
    *
    * -  FIELDS_CHANGE provides configuration for mutation fields.
    * {
    * type: RelayMutationType.FIELDS_CHANGE;
    * fieldIDs: {[fieldName: string]: DataID | Array<DataID>};
    * }
    * where fieldIDs map `fieldName`s from the fatQuery to a DataID or
    * array of DataIDs to be updated in the store.
    *
    * -  RANGE_ADD provides configuration for adding a new edge to a range.
    * {
    * type: RelayMutationType.RANGE_ADD;
    * parentName: string;
    * parentID: string;
    * connectionName: string;
    * edgeName: string;
    * rangeBehaviors:
    * {[call: string]: GraphQLMutatorConstants.RANGE_OPERATIONS};

    * where `parentName` is the field in the fatQuery that contains the range,
    * `parentID` is the DataID of `parentName` in the store, `connectionName`
    * is the name of the range, `edgeName` is the name of the key in server
    * response that contains the newly created edge, `rangeBehaviors` maps
    * stringified representation of calls on the connection to
    * GraphQLMutatorConstants.RANGE_OPERATIONS.
    *
    * -  NODE_DELETE provides configuration for deleting a node and the
    * corresponding edge from a range.
    * {
    * type: RelayMutationType.NODE_DELETE;
    * parentName: string;
    * parentID: string;
    * connectionName: string;
    * deletedIDFieldName: string;
    * }
    * where `parentName`, `parentID` and `connectionName` refer to the same
    * things as in RANGE_ADD, `deletedIDFieldName` is the name of the key in
    * the server response that contains the DataID of the deleted node.
    *
    * -  RANGE_DELETE provides configuration for deleting an edge from a range
    * but doesn't delete the node.
    * {
    * type: RelayMutationType.RANGE_DELETE;
    * parentName: string;
    * parentID: string;
    * connectionName: string;
    * deletedIDFieldName: string;
    * pathToConnection: Array<string>;
    * }
    * where `parentName`, `parentID`, `connectionName` and
    * `deletedIDFieldName` refer to the same things as in NODE_DELETE,
    * `pathToConnection` provides a path from `parentName` to
    * `connectionName`.
    *
    * -  REQUIRED_CHILDREN is used to append additional children (fragments or
    * fields) to the mutation query. Any data fetched as a result of these
    * children is not written to the client store. Please avoid using this.
    * {
